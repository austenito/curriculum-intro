#Method Man
**Learning Goal:** Practice syntax, structure, and argument use when creating methods

**Reference:**
```
Outline of a sample method

def martian_name(name)
  <logic that converts name to a martian name>
end
```
**Task:** Create the method needed to solve the outlined problem

####1: Write a method that will take a word as an argument and uppercases it and adds a "!"
```
shout("billy") #=> "BILLY!"
```

####2: Write a method that takes 2 arguments.  The 1st argument should be a number and the 2nd should be the divisor.
**Hint:** Remember to put a check inside your method so that you cannot divide by zero
```
divide(10,5) #=> 2
divide(20,0) #=> "Sorry, can't divide by zero"
```

####3: Write a method that creats a mad libs joke.  The method should take 3 arguments a noun, verb, and an adjective.
Use the below format as the outline for your method
```
A <noun> <verb> into a bar.
Wow this joke is already <adj> funny!

bar_joke("dolphin", "flys", "tiny")
 #=> "A dolphin flys into a bar.  Wow, this joke is already tiny funny!"

```
