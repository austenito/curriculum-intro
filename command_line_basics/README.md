#Enough To Get By
What is the command line exactly?  Simply put, it is where you interact with your computer's processing power.  From the command line you give your computer a command like `mkdir` <-(we'll learn what this does in a moment) and your computer will execute the command.  Before the invention of the mouse, the command line was how you interacted with a computer.  If you needed to open an application or remove a file - it was done through the command line.

So, why should you learn to work with the command line instead of using your mouse and other tools?  Because as programmers we need to be able to quickly navigate and manipulate the files within our computer.  Moving through file directories, saving new files, and deleting folders can all be accomplished much faster from the command line.

The following commands are the basics.  But they are enough for our purposes and should make you much more efficient and comfortable when working from the command line.

**Note:** You are working on a Window's machine which runs a different operating system from Macs.  The following commands are specific to your OS (albeit some commands do work on both systems).

#Opening the Command Line

* 1) Click the `Start|Run` button in the bottom left
* 2) Type: `CMD`
* 3) Hit enter
