#Command and Conquer
**Learning Goal:** Understand paths, file creation, viewing, and deleting

**Task:** Dominate the command line like you were born to

1) Create a new directory called `codelater`

####Oops! You realize it needs to be called `codenow`

2) Move up a directory and delete `codelate`
3) Make a new directory properly named `codenow`
4) Create a new file inside `codenow ` called `hello world.txt`

####Oops! We should really not name files with spaces, use underscores instead

5) Rename the file `hello world.txt` to `hello_world.rb`
6) Open `hello_world.rb` with Sublime Text
7) Write `puts "Hello World"` and save the file
8) Run the file so that "Hello World" shows up in command line
9) Open `IRB` and load the file
