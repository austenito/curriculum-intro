# FizzBuzz 

Are you ready for a test?

Get ready for `FizzBuzz`, a classic programming challenge engineers receive as a rite of passage during programming
interviews.

# Modulo

Before we get started, you'll need to learn about the `modulo` operator to solve FizzBuzz. `modulo` is a fancy way
of saying 

_"Give me the remainder when dividing two numbers"_

The `modulo` operator is the percent sign, `%` and can be used just like addition and subtraction.

```
6 % 2 
=> 0

6 % 4
=> 2
```

# FizzBuzz Rules

Now that you understand `modulo`, you'll have everything you need to solve `FizzBuzz`. The rules are simple:

For numbers 1 through 50:

* Print `Fizz` for every number divisible by 3
* Print `Buzz` for every number divisible by 5
* Print `FizzBuzz` for every number divisible by 3 and 5

```
# Example Output
3 - Fizz
5 - Buzz
6 - Fizz
9 - Fizz
10 - Buzz
12 - Fizz
15 - FizzBuzz
```
