#Ideal Course Overview

##Mission: Understand the basics of Ruby, learn how to break problems down, and create a foundation for continued learning.

###*Assuming 36 hours live instructor training + 10 hours offline work

#Pre-Work 2 hours

###Introduce strings, integer, variables, array (1-5 in Ruby in 100 Minutes)
  * HW: Describe briefly what each data type is
  * HW: Answer sample problems (store your name in a variable etc...)


#Week 1 Takeaways
  * Understand basic data types and how to use (strings, numbers, arrays, variables)
  * Simple debugging (puts, and command line number)
  * Syntax (indenting, tab space=2)
  * Pseudocode (break into small chunks, solve in english first)
  * Simple linux (cd, mkdir, open file, mv, rm)
  * Conditionals (if, elsif, else)

#Week 2 Takeaways
  * Intro to hash (what it is, syntax, when to use)
  * Loops (while, until)
  * Counters (x = x + 1)
  * Enumerable (each, collect)
  * Methods (how to create, use, return values)
  * Logic (and, or, not)

#Week 3 Takeaways
  * OOP (classes)
  * Twitter
  * Programming into the future (api, web apps)
  * Fizzbuzz

#General Thoughts
  * Curriculum should be additive
  * Checkpoints are a must
  * Handful of sample problems that continue to be refactored
    * Start with pseudocode
    * easiest solution that works
    * methods
    * oop
