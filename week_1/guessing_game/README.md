##Guessing Game

We're going to write a guessing game. The computer is going to generate a secret number, and we're going to get 5 guesses to figure out what the number is. Each turn, we'll input a number and if we didn't guess the secret number, the computer will tell us if our guess is high or low.

If we run out of turns before we can guess the numbers, we lose the game.
