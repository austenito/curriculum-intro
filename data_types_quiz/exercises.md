#Apples to Oranges
**Learning Goal:** Show difference between strings and integers

**Task:** For each of the following, determine whether the result is an `integer`, `string`, or `TypeError` (ie impossible)

```
5 + 5
"5" + 5
5 * "apples"
'8 * 4'
"14ab" + "" + "37bob"
25 / 5
"eyes" + "wide" + "shut"
"s" + ("o" * 5) + "big"
"uni" * "corn"
```

#Stay Fly
**Learning Goal:** Practice using the basic `String` methods as well as local variables and arrays

**Task:**  You are a baller.  Time to spend some green on some bling.  You decide to buy four new cars.  Create 4 `local_variables`.  Each one should represent a new car you purchased.  Add each car to an `Array` called `my_garage`.  Go through each car in your garage and print it to the screen in all uppercase letters.

Extension: Friend asks what cars you have in your garage.  Respond with a string that joins the all the cars in your garage, seperated by a comma.

```
example
everyday_ride = "bmw 740i"
beach_ride = "jeep wrangler"
party_whip = "tesla roadster"
etc...

my_garage = []

add each ride to the empty array

print the array to screen like so...

"BMW 740I"
"JEEP WRANGLER"
"TESLA ROADSTER"

Ext example

"I drive a bmw 740i, jeep wrangler, tesla roadster."

```
